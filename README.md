# 🧼 Clean Architecture Flutter App

This Flutter app is built entirely following **Clean Architecture** principles and best coding practices. It is structured for **feature-wise development**, making it **highly adaptable, scalable, and easy to maintain**.

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns using layers — `presentation`, `domain`, and `data`.
* ✅ **Feature-wise structure**: Each feature is isolated, making the app modular and scalable.
* ✅ **Best coding practices**: SOLID principles, testable code, and clear separation of UI, logic, and data.
* ✅ **Highly adaptable**: Easily extendable to support new features and platforms.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

Follow these steps if you already have Flutter set up on your system:

### 1. Clone the repository (or download it)

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-project-folder>
```

### 2. Replace your `lib` folder

Extract the provided compressed `lib` folder and replace the existing one in your project with it.

```bash
# Assuming you're in your project directory:
rm -rf lib
# Then extract the provided lib folder here
unzip path_to_compressed_lib.zip -d .
```

### 3. Get dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Run the app

```bash
flutter run
```

> You can specify the target device using `-d` flag:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome     # For web
flutter run -d emulator-5554  # For Android emulator
```
